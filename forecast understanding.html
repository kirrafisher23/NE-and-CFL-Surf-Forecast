            <h3>Winds: What Is Offshore?</h3>
            <h5>Offshore winds, where the wind blows from land to sea. Strong offshore winds (over 10 Kts) can make paddling into waves challenging, as the wind pushes you back. Light offshore winds create fun, glassy conditions, but these moments are usually brief in Florida. </h5>

        <div class="windUnderstandingOnshore">
            <h3>Winds: What Is Onshore?</h3>
            <h5>Onshore winds, blowing from sea to land, are the primary source of Florida's wind swells, often caused by cold fronts, nor'easters, or hurricanes off the coast. While these swells can be fun, they create choppy wave faces, and strong onshores can make conditions too way too choppy/blown out for rideable conditions. </h5>

        <div class="windUnderstandingSideshore">
            <h3>Winds: What Is Crossshore/Sideshore?</h3>
            <h5>Crosshore (sideshore) winds blow either north or south, making it harder to go right or left on a wave face. A north wind favors the left face due to less wind resistance, though the face may be weaker; the same applies for a south wind favoring the right face. Crosshore winds can mix with onshore or offshore directions. When crosshore winds dominate, expect a strong current: NNE winds create a southward drift, while SSE winds result in a heavy northward current.</h5>

                <h3> Swell Periods</h3>
                <h5>Swell periods, measured in seconds, indicate the time between wave pulses and often align with wind conditions. Periods over 10 seconds signal a ground or hurricane swell. Short periods (5-6 seconds) combined with strong onshore/sideshore winds indicate a wind swell. </h5>

            <div class="waveHeight">
                <h3>Wave Height</h3>
                <h5>Wave height is often debated due to the "Hawaiian wave scale" and the subjective nature of estimating heights at the beach. Swell period plays a key role in wave size, as longer periods indicate swells traveling farther with more energy, creating larger wave faces than expected. For example, a buoy reading of 3ft @ 13sec represents a ground swell, which could translate to chest-to-head-high waves for the average surfer. </h5>

            <div class="tides">
                <h3>Tides</h3>
                <h5>Tides may not play a big part on determining swells, but they do play an important part in how the wave breaks. 
                    When a certain spot hits high tide and it has a weak outer sandbar, the spot may be useless, and the wave is just crashing on the shore even though there is a swell. Wait about 6 hours or so and paddle out again. 
                    Same goes for weak sandbars that only work well at high tide. The wave dredges and slams on the shore. In Florida "sandbar restoration" is a joke with all its fake sand hence the weak sandbars. </h5>
